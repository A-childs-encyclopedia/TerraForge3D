# Support

I am just a Highschool student so I may not have the best quality of code but still i am trying my best to write good code!
Any support would be highly appretiated!
For example you could add a feature and contribute via pull requests or you could even report any issues with the program!
And the best thing you could do to support this project is spread word about this so that more people who might be interested in this may use this!
