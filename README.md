<a href="https://ctt.ac/MX5_c"><img src="http://clicktotweet.com/img/tweet-graphic-4.png" alt="Tweet: Check out TerraGen3D Free and Open Source Procedural Modelling and Texturing Software : https://github.com/Jaysmito101/TerraGen3D" /></a>

# What can this do?

* Generte 3D Terrain Procedrally
* Export Terrain mesh as OBJ
* You can write and test your own shaders
* An Inbuilt IDE for shaders
* Test under different lighting
* A 3D viewer
* A Node based as well as Layer based workflow
* Save the project(custom `.terr3d` files)
* Hieght map visualizer in node editor
* Wireframe mode
* Custom Lighiting
* Customizable Geometry Shaders included in rendering pipeline
* Skyboxes
* Multithreded Mesh Generation

# Expected Goals for Version 3

* Add a lot more Nodes
* Export to heightmaps(both PNG and also custom format)
* Node based procedural texture editing
* Custom Skyboxes
* Completely usable 3D procedural modelling and texturing pipeline
* Fix as many bugs I can find

# Things that may be added

* [Wren](https://wren.io/) scripting to add custom algotrithms
* Procedural grass and foliage
* Fix more bugs!

# Support

I am just a Highschool student so I may not have the best quality of code but still i am trying my best to write good code!

Any support would be highly appretiated!

For example you could add a feature and contribute via pull requests or you could even report any issues with the program!

And the best thing you could do to support this project is spread word about this so that more people who might be interested in this may use this!

Please considering tweeting about this!
